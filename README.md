- 👋 Hi, I’m @ElizabethPappalardo
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my tech skills, content creation, personal branding and when I'm not in front of my laptop, its being out in nature, hiking and standup paddleboarding.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GitHub ;)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on community initiatives to empower others to make a positive impact in our world
- 📫 Reach me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethpappalardo), connect and say hi!
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favourite quote is "Follow your bliss", by Joseph Campbell. If you follow your bliss doors will open you never thought possible.✨
